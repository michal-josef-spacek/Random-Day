1. Osetrit spatne vstupy.
2. Lze nejak lepe preposilat DateTime error?
3. GT issue - Just a suggestion: wouldn't it be simpler and more lightweight if
you convert dt_from and dt_to to epoch, then calculate a random number roughly
between epoch_from and epoch_to, then convert back to DateTime object?
